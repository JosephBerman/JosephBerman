Hi!

I'm Joseph!

I have a Master of Science in Computer Engineering with a concentration in Computer Systems and Software from Northeastern University.

Verilog and C are my favorite languages.

My interest is seeing my code interact with the physical world. 

Although most of my experience has been in robotics, I enjoy everything that bridges programming to life.
